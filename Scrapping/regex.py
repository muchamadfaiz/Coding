# Parse website data using regular expression (regex)
"""
Real-world HTML can be much more complicated and 
far less predictable than the HTML on the Aphrodite profile page. 
Hereâ€™s another profile page with some messier HTML that you can scrape
"""
# 1. call module request on urllib (library) and import urlopen (function)
from urllib.request import urlopen

# 2. call module "re" for activating regular expression
import re

# 3. make variable named "url" to store a string of url web page
url = 'http://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/poseidon'

# 4. to open a remote object across a network (can read HTML, files, images, etc)
# and it will return a HTTPResponse object -> output = http.client.HTTPResponse object at 0x00000289E3003340
page = urlopen(url) 

# 5. to extract HTML from the page -> return sequence of bytes
html_bytes = page.read() 

# 6. to decode the bytes to a string using (UTF-8) --> for reading in terminal python
html = html_bytes.decode("utf-8") # decode the bytes to a string using (UTF-8)
# print(type(html))
print(html)

# Extract Text wtihin tag <title> from HTML with regex --> we cant use string method in previous ex.

# 1. make a pattern using regex
pattern = "<title.*>(.*)</title.*>"

# 2. use re.findall(pattern, string) to search the pattern on the string
title = re.findall(pattern, html)
# print(title) # --> [Profile: Poseidon]

# 3. and you can substitute/replace the word with re.sub()
sub = re.sub("<.*>","pawpaw",html) #substitute anyword inside <> with greedy method
# print(sub)

# 4. and you can substitute/replace the word with re.sub()
sub = re.sub("<.*?>","pawpaw",html) #substitute anyword inside <> with non-greedy method
# print(sub)
